Accessibility Exercise

A basic "what-not-to-do" page meant to be corrected with accessibility best practices

1. Using semantic HTML, rename the `div` elements in `Page.tsx` to something more appropriate. There may be times
where `div` is the best option but there will be very few of them.

2. Using the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, correct any other accessibility issues you see. Do not turn
linting on as this would defeat the purpose.
